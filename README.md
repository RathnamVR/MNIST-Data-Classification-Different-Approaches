# MNIST Data Classification with Different Approaches 
This contains an experiment I did on MNIST data classification using Multilayer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Networks. I changed various parameters in these models to check how the prediction accuracy vary. My goal was to find the model that gives best accuracy and least time consuming.
